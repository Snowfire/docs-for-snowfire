# Snippets


- All snippets in the `examples` folder are included by default in Snowfire

- You can replace existing default snippets by creating a new one with the same name. Then copy/paste the from the code here.

- Please note that you need to use auto generated `id` in snippets components like this: `id: '{{ compontent_id_0 }}'` (instead of a simple numeric id). This is because a snippet might be used multiple times on a single page.

- Currently there are no css included since everything is included in the main css.

- Some snippets require javascript, which is loaded by default by Snowfire.
