# Blocks

- All blocks are included by default in Snowfire
- You can replace existing default blocks by creating a new one with the same name. Then copy/paste the from the code here.
- Please note that you need to use auto generated `id` in blocks components like this: `id: '{{ compontent_id_0 }}'` (instead of a simple numeric id). This is because a block might be used multiple times on a single page.
- Currently there are no css included since everything is included in the main css.
- Some blocks require javascript, which is loaded by default by Snowfire.
